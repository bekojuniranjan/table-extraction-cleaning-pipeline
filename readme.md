# Percentage of Spanning Calculation

This spanning cell information is basically used to calculate the amount of span in the cell. And, later will be used for error analysis. 

---
$ total spanning = \sum_{forall col spanning cell} colspanamount - 1  + \sum_{forallrow spanning cell} rowspanamount - 1 $

$ totalnoofcell = totalnooftd + totalspanning $

$ percentage of spanning = \frac{total spanning}{totalnoofcell}$
